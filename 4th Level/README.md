### Level 4: Connecting to routers

This is about connecting to a router than sending information through a router and is similar to level 3 in setting IP and Subnet Masks as R1 can be the equivalent of C1 in the Previous level.

2 Easy ways of completing level 4

1. 
### Interface R1 IP
- Same numbers as Interface R3 IP, except the last number has to be different. 

### Interface B1 IP
- Same numbers as Interface B1 IP, except the last number has to be different. 

### Interface B1 Mask & A1 Mask
- The mask numbers are the same as each other. 
 
 2. (this works but won't help you for the upcoming levels)
 
 ### Subnet Masks
 - set all to 0.0.0.0, works up to all Subnet Mask values below 255.255.0.0.
