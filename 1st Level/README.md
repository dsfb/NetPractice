### Level 1 - Understanding IP addresses
- As Submask is preset to 255.255.255.0, everything between 104.94.23.1 and 104.94.23.254 can be classified as being on the same network, this allows for  IP addresses that aren't sequential in value e.g. 104.94.23.42 and 104.94.23.75 to form routes.

### Interface A1 IP
- A1 IP matches B1, except the last number has to be different then A1's IP Number

### Interface D1 IP
- D1 IP matches C1, except the last 2 numbers has to be different then D1
